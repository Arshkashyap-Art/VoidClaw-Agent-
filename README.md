## 📖 Overview

VoidClaw is a highly advanced, local-first AI agent framework. It acts as a continuous autonomous assistant that learns your preferences over time, interacts with your local filesystem, scrapes the web, and proactively manages your digital life. Designed for portability, it runs seamlessly on high-end PCs and Android phones alike, turning your device into an autonomous mission hub.

## 🌟 Major Highlights

*   **📱 Android System Control (Shizuku):** VoidClaw is now integrated with **Shizuku**. It can autonomously open apps, navigate your phone (Home/Back), adjust volume, and execute raw `adb shell` commands directly from your chat.
*   **⏰ 24/7 Proactive Autonomy:** Set reminders, briefings, or complex tasks in seconds or minutes. VoidClaw proactively "messages" you across all channels with sound notifications and unique UI transmissions when a task triggers.
*   **🧠 Evolutionary Memory:** Automatically deduces and records your preferences, workflows, and expertise in a permanent neural vault to adapt its personality and assistance to you.
*   **🌐 Tri-Channel Interface:** Seamlessly switch between a premium **Glassmorphism Web UI**, remote control via **Telegram**, or a high-resolution **Terminal Dashboard**. All channels are synchronized in real-time.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

### 🤖 Autonomous Core
- **ReAct Reasoning:** Multi-step thinking loop with live "Thought" transparency.
- **Universal LLM Adapter:** Support for **Gemini 1.5, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Ollama (Local), NVIDIA NIM, and OpenRouter**.
- **Mission Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, Token usage, and active autonomous tasks.

### 🧰 The Tool Arsenal
- **Android Control:** Launch apps (e.g., YouTube), simulate hardware buttons, and touch events via Shizuku.
- **Advanced Web Tools:** Multi-stage web scraper and search with a stealth fallback system for Termux.
- **Media Suite:** High-quality YouTube downloading (Video/Audio) and automatic media conversion.
- **File Intelligence:** Sandboxed filesystem access and **Local RAG Semantic Search** across your workspace documents.
- **Smart Scheduler:** Human-friendly reminder system ("remind me every 30s") and professional Cron support.

### 🖥️ Premium Web Command Center
- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Android browsers with a slide-out Mission Hub and floating input.
- **Operational Control:** Mid-response interruption (Stop Button) and secure document attachments.
- **Memory Vault:** Browse, search, and instantly restore previous neural logs from the sidebar.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

VoidClaw is designed to be **100% portable**. 

### 📱 Android (Termux) - The Mobile Command Center

1.  **Install Termux:** Download [Termux from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).
2.  **Run the Quick Setup:**
    ```bash
    pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
    pkg install git -y
    git clone https://github.com/AbuZar-Ansarii/VoidClaw-Agent.git
    cd VoidClaw-Agent
    chmod +x termux/install.sh termux/run.sh
    ./termux/install.sh
    ```
3.  **Enable Android Control (Zero-Config Shizuku Setup):**
    VoidClaw now features **Auto-Provisioning** for Shizuku. No manual file moving required!

    *   **Step A: Install Shizuku**
        Download and install the [Shizuku App](https://shizuku.rikka.app/download/) on your phone.
    *   **Step B: Start Shizuku Service**
        Open the Shizuku app and start the service (usually via **Wireless Debugging** in Android Developer Options).
    *   **Step C: Export & Grant Permission**
        1.  In Shizuku app, tap **"Use Shizuku in terminal apps"** -> **"Export files"**.
        2.  Save them into a folder named **"Shizuku"** in your phone's Internal Storage.
        3.  In Termux, run: `termux-setup-storage` and grant permission.
    *   **Step D: That's it!**
        The next time you tell VoidClaw to control your phone (e.g., *"Open YouTube"*), it will **automatically** import and configure the files for you.

    *   **Step E: Manual Verification (Optional)**
        Type `rish` in Termux. If it shows a shell prompt (`$`), you are ready! Type `exit` to return.
        *(Note: Termux does NOT need to be toggled in 'Authorized applications' when using this method)*

### 🪟 Windows Setup
1. Double-click `windows\install.bat` and follow the wizard.
2. Double-click `windows\run.bat` to launch.

### 🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux Setup
1. Run: `chmod +x linux/install.sh linux/run.sh && ./linux/install.sh`
2. To launch: `./linux/run.sh`
